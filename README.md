# Face-Recognition-using-one-shot-learning
This project implements a face recognition system using one-shot learning. 
The model is designed to recognize faces with minimal training data, making it suitable for scenarios where acquiring a large dataset for each individual is impractical.
Dataset
The model is trained on a one-shot learning dataset, which includes images of individuals with only one sample per person. The dataset is organized into folders, each containing images of a single individual.
